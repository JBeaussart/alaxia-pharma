    <h1>CysticFibrosis</h1>

    <p>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common inherited life-limiting genetic
      condition in Caucasian populations and is a chronic debilitating disease
      that affects around 70,000 individuals worldwide.

    <p>
      Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutation of the gene that encodes for the
      CFTR membrane protein. CFTR is required for correct ion transport and
      fluid regulation across the bodyâ€™s epithelial barriers, such as the
      linings of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The mutation leads
      to abnormal accumulation of thick mucus secretions which can impair
      pancreatic function, food absorption and reduce lung respiratory function.
      At the lung level, the mutation of CFTR induces defective bacterial
      killing and bacterial clearance. Indeed, the CFTR mutation modifies the
      natural defenses of the lung against bacteria and the abnormal quantity of
      mucus creates an ideal environment for bacteria growth. Both factors lead
      to chronic and recurrent lung infections and a continuous inflammatory
      state that increases lung injury. CF respiratory infections have such a
      serious impact on lung function and long term health outcomes for patients
      that successful treatments or eradication of these microbes (often
      multi-drug resistant because of long-term exposure to conventional
      antibiotics) are of prime importance to improving prognosis and quality of
      life.
