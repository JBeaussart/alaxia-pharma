      <strong class="news_date">Lyon, France, September 21, 2020</strong> – Alaxia, an affiliate
      of the Stragen Pharma Group developing therapeutic solutions for
      respiratory diseases, today announces a cooperation with a BSL3 (BioSafety
      Level 3) laboratory of University of Padova (Department of Molecular
      Medicine, DMM) to test in vitro the virucidal effect of the antimicrobial
      compound ALX-009 (combination of OSCN- and lactoferrin) against
      SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for Covid-19. The tests reinforce the
      interest in investigating ALX-009 against bacterial and viral lung
      infections and/or co-infections, in a broader range of life-threatening
      agents.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      ALX-009, the company’s lead compound, is an antimicrobial product
      originally developed for Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients to fight antibiotic
      multi-resistant Gram negative bacteria. Current therapies do not target
      these bacteria, that induce a rapid decline in the respiratory capacity,
      health status and survival of patients. Alaxia’s in vitro and ex vivo
      tests showed 100% efficacy on several strains (Burkholderia spp.,
      multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Achromobacter spp. and
      Stenotrophomonas spp.).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      In 2013 Alaxia, in collaboration with DMM, tested hypothiocyanite (OSCN-)
      in vitro against
      <a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23540488/"
        >A/H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza virus</a
      >, showing a clear dose-dependent virucidal activity without cell
      toxicity. According to Luca Cegolon – medical epidemiologist who promoted
      Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 investigations: “This compound has considerable
      potential. Not only does it show great promise in the treatment of cystic
      fibrosis patients, but it clearly has a large spectrum cidal activity.
      Indeed, since OSCN- is an endogenous molecule and is part of the natural
      human immune system against pathogen threats, the risk of side effects in
      humans is inevitably low”.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      During summer 2020, Alaxia and DMM started to investigate the potential of
      ALX-009 on SARS-CoV-2. “Seeing preliminary results, additional tests will
      be performed to confirm the potential virucidal activity of ALX-009 on
      SARS-CoV-2,” said Cristiano Salata from DMM. A scientific paper, detailing
      BSL3 lab tests results, will be submitted for peer review before the end
      of 2020.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      ALX-009 is produced extemporaneously by dedicated equipment EOLEASE as and
      when needed for managing multiresistant bacterial infections. ALX-009 was
      developed to be administered by inhalation. In February 2020 Alaxia
      completed its phase 1 clinical trial cohorts enrolling 84 healthy
      volunteers (phase 1a) to study the safety profile of the compound. ALX-009
      was deemed safe to inhale. The company has started recruiting cystic
      fibrosis and bronchiectasis patients at several EU clinical sites to
      complete this ongoing study (phase 1b).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      “The promising effect on SARS-CoV-2 suggests that ALX-009 can be an
      antimicrobial with virucidal properties. With the phase 1 clinical trial
      data, we were able to determine that ALX-009 is a safe breathable
      antimicrobial drug candidate. It could be an important tool to treat a
      large array of life threatening agents in CF,” said Philippe Bordeau, VP
      Innovation and Business Development at Alaxia. “We look forward to
      increasing the interest around ALX-009 and to finding one or more partners
      to hasten our development programs.”

    <p><strong>About ALX-009</strong></p>
    <p>
      ALX-009 targets antibiotic-multi-resistant Gram negative bacteria (‘super
      bugs’) that are currently untreatable. It combines two endogenous
      substances: the hypothiocyanite ion (OSCN-) and the protein lactoferrin.
      Both compounds are normally present in healthy people as part of the
      body’s first line of defense against microbes; the innate immune system.
      The drug can be used as a stand-alone therapy and as an adjunctive to
      antibiotics or other therapeutics. <br />
      In vitro and ex vivo tests have shown that the bactericidal effect was
      maintained in complex matrices (biofilm and sputum) which is important as
      it works without requiring significant dose increases for respiratory
      infections in cystic fibrosis. ALX-009 has orphan drug status both in the
      US and the EU. Both the drug and the technologies are patented.

    <p><strong>About Alaxia </strong></p>
    <p>
      Alaxia, an affiliate of the Stragen Pharma Group, specializes in
      developing antimicrobial therapies for cystic fibrosis and other chronic
      respiratory diseases. Its lead product, ALX-009, a first-in-class orphan
      drug candidate, consists of two endogenous microbiocide substances that
      provide innate immunity defense within healthy lungs. Currently in a phase
      1b trial, ALX-009 aims at treating cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis
      infections against multi-drug resistant Gram negative bacteria. <br />
      Alaxia is backed by the French public bank Bpifrance and the Cystic
      Fibrosis Foundation, with support from Stragen and the iABC consortium.
      The iABC consortium is a project within the ND4BB program under the IMI
      (Innovative Medicines Initiative), a Public Private Partnership between
      the European Union and the European pharmaceutical industry. Founded in
      2008 in Lyon, France, the ALX-009 program is led by Dr. Victor Juarez
      Perez, project leader and Annie
